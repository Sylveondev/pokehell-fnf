## Pokehell - Psych Edition
This is the **Psych Edition** of Pokehell, obviously running on the Psych Engine. What is Psych Engine exactly? What are you, stupid? Everyone knows what Psych Engine is... Psych Engine was originally used on [Mind Games Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107), intended to be a fix for the vanilla version's many issues while keeping the casual play aspect of it. Also aiming to be an easier alternative to newbie coders.
